Thank you for using SlashSearch! We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.

1. Information We Collect
SlashSearch does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information. SlashSearch operates entirely within your browser and does not send any data to external servers. All user preferences and settings are stored locally or in Chrome’s chrome.storage.sync for synchronization across your devices if you are signed into Chrome.

2. Data Usage
The data stored by SlashSearch is limited to:

Custom Settings: SlashSearch stores your preferences for specific websites, allowing you to enable or disable the / key functionality on certain sites. These settings are stored locally on your device or in Chrome’s synchronized storage to ensure consistency across devices if you are signed into Chrome.
Website Interaction: SlashSearch uses the activeTab permission to interact with the currently active website solely to locate and focus the search box when you press the / key. This interaction is limited to the active website and occurs only within your browser.
SlashSearch does not access or collect any browsing history, personal information, or user activity outside the functionality required to focus on search boxes.

3. Data Sharing
SlashSearch does not share any data with third parties. We do not collect, store, or transmit any information outside of your browser.
